# Fn65

Fn65 is a work in progress programming language for the 8-bit 6502 microprocessor.
It is meant to increase programmer productivity and improve code clarity for
homebrew platforms such as the NES, Atari 2600 and Commodore 64.
Fn65 is a language that features type safety and certain high-level syntaxes at
a minimimal-to-no performance cost.

At this point in time, much of the language design is still in my head.
Please bear with me while the actual compiler gets implemented.
